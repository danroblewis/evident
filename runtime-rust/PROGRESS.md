# Rust runtime — progress log

**Read this first when resuming.** Tells you what's done, what's next, and any blockers.

## Current status

**Phase:** v0.7 — cached evaluator landed. 29/29 tests green.

**Last action:** Ported the Python `evaluate_cached` optimization.
Runtime owns a leaked `Box<Context>` (one per process — fine for a
CLI tool / test suite) and a `RefCell<HashMap<String, CachedSchema>>`.
First `query_cached` for a schema runs `build_cache` (declarations +
constraint translation into a fresh solver); subsequent queries hit
`run_cached` which does push → assert givens → check → extract → pop.

Perf smoke: **195ms uncached vs 5.8ms cached** over 100 iterations of
a small multi-passthrough schema (~33× speedup). Bigger margin than
the Python port saw (3-6×) — Z3 retains more state when the solver
is reused.

**Next action:** Seq sort runtime support is now top of the list —
parser/AST already there, just need to wrap `z3_sys::Z3_mk_seq_sort`
ourselves (the safe `z3` crate doesn't expose a generic `Seq<T>`).

## Milestones

- [x] **M0**: Cargo project compiles, `z3` crate dependency builds, a
  trivial `Solver::new + check()` test passes. Validates toolchain.
- [x] **M1**: AST types defined for the v0.1 subset (SchemaDecl,
  Membership, Expr, BinOp).
- [x] **M2**: Lexer handles ASCII tokens + the Unicode operators
  (`∈`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬`, `⇒`, `≤`, `≥`, `≠`). `--` comments.
  Indentation tracked via `Indent(n)` tokens after `Newline`.
- [x] **M3**: Parser parses `schema/claim/type Name` with indented body
  containing `x ∈ Type` decls and arbitrary expression constraints.
  Standard precedence climbing (implies → or → and → compare → +/- →
  */ → unary → atom).
- [x] **M4**: Translate `n ∈ Nat` to `Int.new_const + n >= 0`. `n ∈ Bool`
  to `Bool.new_const`. Comparisons, arithmetic, boolean combinators.
- [x] **M5**: Runtime API: `EvidentRuntime::new() → load_source(s) →
  query("Name") → QueryResult { satisfied, bindings }`.
- [x] **M6**: First Python-equivalent test passes:
  `SimpleNat { n ∈ Nat ; n > 5 }` returns satisfied with `n > 5`.

## Known gotchas (record as we hit them)

- **Z3 headers location.** The `z3-sys` crate needs `z3.h` and a libz3
  to link against. We don't have homebrew z3 installed; instead we
  point at the copy bundled with Python's `z3-solver` package (used
  by the parent runtime). See `.cargo/config.toml`. If you move
  Anaconda or upgrade, those paths will break.
- **Bool equality vs Int equality.** `translate_bool` has to try Bool
  operands first and fall back to Int for `Eq`/`Neq`. Otherwise
  `p = true` (Bool) gets routed through `translate_int` and silently
  drops. Same trap exists in the Python translator for indexed Bool
  fields (the "= true / = false" workaround in CLAUDE.md).
- **Initial Indent(0) emission.** Don't emit `Indent(0)` in the
  lexer prologue — the `at_line_start = true` initial state will
  cause the first non-blank stretch to emit one naturally. Otherwise
  you get a duplicate Indent and the parser's first-token check fails.
- **Lexer `at_line_start` bookkeeping is fragile.** When skipping
  blank lines or comment-only lines inside the at_line_start branch,
  remember to keep `at_line_start = true` (don't fall through to the
  general loop).
- **Membership-decl vs membership-constraint disambiguation.** Both
  `n ∈ Nat` (declaration) and `n ∈ {3, 5, 7}` (set membership) parse
  the same prefix. The body-item parser distinguishes by lookahead:
  if `IDENT IN IDENT` is followed by a line terminator (Newline, Eof,
  Indent), it's a declaration; otherwise it's an expression. Without
  this you can't write `n ∈ Nat` then later `m ∈ Bool` etc. and have
  set-membership constraints in the same body.
- **Z3 ast types are RC-cloneable.** `Int<'ctx>`, `Bool<'ctx>`,
  `String<'ctx>` from the `z3` crate impl `Clone` cheaply (they're
  internal-RC). So `#[derive(Clone)]` on the env's `Var` enum works,
  which is what makes quantifier unrolling clean (clone env, shadow
  the bound var, recurse on body).
- **Quantifier bound must be a literal range for now.** `∀ i ∈ {lo..hi}`
  unrolls only when both `lo` and `hi` are `Expr::Int`. Symbolic bounds
  (`{0..n - 1}` where n is a variable) need the Python length-propagation
  shim — Pass 1/2/3 in `evaluate.py`. Deferred.
- **z3 crate gap: no generic `Seq<T>`.** z3-0.12.1's `ast` module
  exposes `Bool, Int, Real, Float, String, BV, Array, Set, Datatype,
  Dynamic, Regexp` — but no general sequence type. (`String<'ctx>` is
  internally a char-seq via Z3's seq-of-codepoints, but that doesn't
  generalize.) Z3 itself supports `Seq(T)` via `Z3_mk_seq_sort` etc.
  — to use it from Rust we'd need to wrap the FFI ourselves. Until
  then, the parser + AST handle `Seq(T)`, `#x`, and `e[i]` cleanly,
  but `declare_var` warns and skips `Seq(...)` types and the
  translator returns None for Cardinality / Index expressions.

## Cached evaluator (implemented)

Done — went with the leaked-Context design (option 1 in the original
sketch). The runtime owns a `&'static Context` from `Box::leak` and a
`RefCell<HashMap<String, CachedSchema<'static>>>`. First call to
`query_cached` for a given schema runs `build_cache` (declarations +
constraint translation into a fresh solver); subsequent calls run
`run_cached` which does push → assert givens → check → extract → pop.

Notes for anyone touching this:

- `load_source` clears the cache. Loading a new schema can reference
  existing ones via ClaimCall / passthrough, so old cache entries
  may now be stale. Simplest to flush.
- Cache key is the schema name. If you ever support reloading a
  schema by the same name with a different body, cache invalidation
  has to handle that.
- The leaked Context is one per `EvidentRuntime`. Tests create many
  runtimes; each leaks one Context. Fine for a test process; in a
  long-running embedding switch to a `Session<'ctx>` design where
  the caller controls Context lifetime.

## Next slices

Done in this session:

- [x] String literals + `=`/`≠` on strings.
- [x] `given` parameter on `query` (pre-bind values via solver assertion).
- [x] Sub-schema field expansion (`task ∈ Task` → `task.id`,
      `task.duration`, …) — recursive, handles nested user types.
- [x] Set literal expressions `{1, 2, 3}` and ∈ over them.
- [x] Range literals `{lo..hi}` (only valid as a quantifier bound).
- [x] Quantifier translation `∀ i ∈ {lo..hi} : body` — unrolled when
      both bounds are literal Ints.
- [x] `..ClaimName` passthrough composition (names-match).
- [x] Claim composition with mappings (`Foo(x mapsto y, lit mapsto 5)`).
      Bare-identifier and literal mapping values + sub-schema mapping
      (`state mapsto state.player` re-keys every matching field).
- [x] `subclaim` declaration. Body has the same shape as a top-level
      decl; runtime lifts subclaims into the global schemas table so
      they're reachable by ClaimCall / passthrough from anywhere.
- [x] Cardinality `#x` and indexing `e[i]` syntax + AST. Runtime
      translation deferred behind the z3 crate gap.
- [x] `Seq(T)` / `Set(T)` parse as compound type names in membership
      decls. Runtime declaration deferred (logs warning).
- [x] **Cached evaluator.** Leaked `'static Context`,
      `RefCell<HashMap<String, CachedSchema>>` cache, push/pop per
      query. ~33× speedup on a multi-passthrough schema.

In rough order of leverage:

- [ ] **Seq sort runtime support.** z3-0.12 doesn't expose a generic
      `Seq<T>`. Path: write thin wrappers around `z3_sys::Z3_mk_seq_sort`,
      `Z3_mk_seq_length`, `Z3_mk_seq_nth`. Unsafe but small. Once done,
      Cardinality and Index translation come for free.
- [ ] Composite Datatypes for Seq(T)/Set(T) where T is a user type.
- [ ] Cached evaluator (push/pop). See sketch below — non-trivial in
      Rust because the cached solver borrows the Context by lifetime.
- [ ] Symbolic ∀ bounds via length propagation (see Python's
      `evaluate.py` "Pass 1/2/3").
- [ ] `assert name = value` top-level ground facts. Mostly subsumed
      by the `given` parameter, but useful for one-shot REPL-style
      use.
