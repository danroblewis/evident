# Type-refactor log — Phase 1 (discovered TYPES into compiler2)

Branch `type-refactor` off `main`, worktree `/tmp/refactor-wt`.
Gate: `.goalpost/bin/run-conformance.sh` must read **137/138**
(the one known failure is `123-subschema-shadowing-quantifier`).
Records change the emit, so the gate is behavioral, not byte-identical.

Order: most-complex / most-lines-removed first, after a cheap
mechanism proof (FtiBuffer at one carried site).

## Mechanism proof — `FtiBuffer(base ∈ Int, count ∈ Int)`

The recurring base+cursor pair behind every FTI-resident buffer
(token buffer, symbol table, claim index). Wired at ONE real carried
site: the **claim index** (`ci_base` + `ci_cnt` → `cibuf`).

Validated facts (record-carry idiom in the real driver fsm):
- The fsm autocarry transform **synthesizes the record dual**
  `_cibuf ∈ FtiBuffer` automatically (no explicit `_cibuf` decl
  needed) — confirmed in the flattened unit and in isolation.
- A **forward type reference works**: `FtiBuffer` is declared in
  `compiler2/driver_ir.ev` (imported last), yet used in
  `driver_zinit.ev`/`driver_claimidx.ev` which flatten earlier. The
  oracle accepts the use-before-decl.
- A **bare bound constraint on a record field** is accepted:
  `cibuf.count < 2048` (was `ci_cnt ∈ Int < 2048`, a decl+bound; now
  the field is declared by the type, the bound is a plain constraint).
- `_record.field` reads in arbitrary expressions work
  (`_cibuf.count + 1`, `_cibuf.base`).
- Field carry across ticks: base pinned once, count climbs — proven
  by `tests/compiler2_units/types/fti_buffer_carry.ev` and by the
  updated `driver_claimidx/index_append.ev`.

### Call sites rewritten (8 code refs, 6 files)
- `compiler2/driver_ir.ev` — +1 type decl (`FtiBuffer`).
- `compiler2/driver_zinit.ev` — `ci_base` decl+carry → `cibuf`/`cibuf.base`.
- `compiler2/driver_claimidx.ev` — `ci_cnt` decl/bound/carry +
  write addr → `cibuf.count` / `cibuf.base`.
- `compiler2/driver_guard.ev` — `ci_base` read → `cibuf.base`.
- `compiler2/driver_compose.ev` — `ci_base` read → `cibuf.base`.
- `compiler2/driver_posbind.ev` — `ci_base` read → `cibuf.base`.
- `compiler2/driver_emit.ev` — `ci_base` free → `cibuf.base`.
- tests: `driver_claimidx/index_append.ev` updated; new
  `types/fti_buffer_carry.ev` added.

Lines removed (net): ~0 for the proof (one field-pair unified; the
proof's value is establishing the idiom, not deleting lines). The
base+count pair was already split across decls; the win comes from
unifying the remaining two FtiBuffer instances (token buffer, symtab)
and the larger flattened registries.

### Finding — every field of a carried record must be constrained
The kernel carries a record-typed fsm member by carrying each flattened
field const. If a consumer references only ONE field (e.g. DriverGuard
uses `cibuf.base` but never `cibuf.count`), the unused field has no
covering assignment and the kernel aborts at runtime with
`state var \`cibuf.count\` not in model` (functionizer: "an output had
no covering assignment"). Fix: any fsm that pulls in a record member
must constrain ALL its fields, even with an identity carry
(`cibuf.count = (is_first_tick ? 0 : _cibuf.count)`). In the real driver
this is automatic (zinit pins base, claimidx drives count); it only
bites module-isolation fixtures that stub a subset. Implication for
later types: a wide record (e.g. a 42-field Z3 handle bank) forces
EVERY field to be live every tick — fine for a genuinely co-traveling
group, but a reason NOT to lump weakly-related fields into one record.

Unit tests: PASS — 6/6 (types/fti_buffer_carry, driver_claimidx,
driver_compose, driver_emit, driver_guard, driver_posbind).
Gate: **PASS — 137/138** (only known failure
`123-subschema-shadowing-quantifier`; 0 timeouts). COMMITTED `0829183`.

## FtiBuffer instance 2 — token buffer (`tbase` + `lx_count` → `tbuf`)

The highest-traffic FTI buffer: the 65536×32 token arena written by the
lexer and read by the window. Same proven idiom; second instance of the
already-declared `FtiBuffer` type. 12 code refs across 4 modules:
- `driver_zinit.ev` — `tbase` decl+carry → `tbuf`/`tbuf.base`.
- `driver_lex.ev` — bound (`tbuf.count < 65534`), carry, the three
  float-token writes (`tbuf.base + _tbuf.count*32 …`), the EOF write,
  and the `LexFtiPlan(base ↦ tbuf.base, count ↦ _tbuf.count)` call.
- `driver_window.ev` — fetch addr `tbuf.base + _tcur*32`.
- `driver_emit.ev` — free `tbuf.base`.
Fixtures updated: driver_lex/{lex_idents,lex_twochar_op},
driver_window/fetch_burst, driver_emit/estep_walk,
driver_zinit/latch_isort (+ driver_ir import where the module didn't
already pull it; + identity `.count` stubs where a fixture exercises
only `.base`).

Unit tests: PASS — 29/29 (full compiler2_units suite).
Gate: **PASS — 137/138** (only known `123-subschema`; 0 timeouts).
COMMITTED `d3971ed`.

## FtiBuffer instance 3 — symbol table (`st_base` + `st_cnt` → `stbuf`)

Third and final FtiBuffer instance, completing the "instantiated three
times" thesis (token buffer / symbol table / claim index). The 8192×8
handle table. 8 code refs across 5 modules (incl. the big `driver.ev`):
- `driver_zinit.ev` — `st_base` decl+carry → `stbuf`/`stbuf.base`.
- `driver_symtab.ev` — bound (`stbuf.count < 8192`) + carry (init `2`,
  the two kernel-seeded slots).
- `driver_buildeff.ev` — the two D3 seed writes (`stbuf.base`, `+8`).
- `driver.ev` — symtab read (`stbuf.base + 8*(pos/32)`) + the decl
  istep-2 write (`stbuf.base + 8*_stbuf.count`).
- `driver_emit.ev` — free `stbuf.base`.
Fixtures updated: driver_buildeff/{select_w2,select_w5},
driver_emit/estep_walk, driver_zinit/latch_isort,
driver_symtab/decode_peel (declare `stbuf` + stub `.base`, since
DriverSymtab constrains only `.count`; + driver_ir import where absent).

Unit tests: PASS — 29/29.
Gate: **PASS — 137/138** (artifact: total 138, passed 137, failed 1 =
only known `123-subschema`, 0 timeouts, wall 418s, builder oracle).
COMMITTED.

## Summary — FtiBuffer fully landed (3/3 instances)

`type FtiBuffer(base ∈ Int, count ∈ Int)` now unifies all three FTI
base+cursor pairs the analysis flagged (Appendix A.1): the token buffer
(`tbuf`), the symbol table (`stbuf`), and the claim index (`cibuf`).
28 base/cursor code references collapsed onto one declared record type;
the three loose `_base`/`_cnt` decl+carry pairs became three records.

### Record-carry idiom — established facts (the reusable recipe)
1. Declare `x ∈ T` ONCE (in the module that owns the base pin); the fsm
   autocarry transform synthesizes the prev-tick dual `_x ∈ T`. No
   explicit `_x` decl is needed.
2. Field constraints may live in DIFFERENT module fsms (base pinned in
   driver_zinit, cursor driven in driver_lex/symtab/claimidx) — they all
   merge into driver_main via `..Module` and share the one declaration.
3. A bound that was a decl+bound (`cnt ∈ Int < N`) becomes a plain field
   constraint (`x.count < N`); the type already declares the field.
4. Forward type reference is fine — `FtiBuffer` is declared in
   driver_ir.ev (imported last) yet used in earlier-flattened modules.
5. **Every field of a carried record must have a covering assignment
   each tick**, or the kernel aborts (`state var X not in model`). In
   the full driver this is automatic; module-isolation fixtures that use
   only one field must stub the others with an identity carry. This is
   the one real constraint the type system imposes — see the "Finding"
   above. It is also a design guardrail: do NOT lump weakly-related
   fields into one record, because each forces a live value every tick.

## Z3SolverCtx — the solver-lifecycle handle triple (`z_cfg/z_ctx/z_sol`)

First of the cohesive `z_*` sub-records (the prior "god-record" was
rejected; the split is the right shape). `type Z3SolverCtx(cfg, ctx,
sol ∈ Int)` unifies the three Z3 lifecycle handles created consecutively
during zinit (zsteps 1/2/3): the config, the context, the solver. They
are a genuinely co-traveling group — every `Build*Z3` effect threads
`ctx`, every assert goes through `sol` — so all three are driven every
tick by DriverZInit (the every-field-live guardrail is satisfied in the
full driver automatically).

Sites rewritten: 93 references (`z_ctx` alone = 77) across 4 modules,
all READS (slot args `ctx_h ↦ z3ctx.ctx` / `ArgInt(z3ctx.ctx)`):
- `driver_ir.ev` — +1 type decl (`Z3SolverCtx`).
- `driver_zinit.ev` — the three decl+latch lines → `z3ctx` record +
  three field latches (`z3ctx.cfg = is_first_tick ? 0 : zstep=1 ? … :
  _z3ctx.cfg`, etc.). Doc header updated.
- `driver_buildeff.ev` — ~40 `z_ctx` slot args + `z_cfg`/`z_sol`.
- `driver.ev` — ~25 build-step slot args.
- `driver_record.ev`, `driver_emit.ev` — the remaining reads.
Fixtures: driver_buildeff/{select_w2,select_w5}, driver_emit/estep_walk
(their stub `z_cfg/z_ctx/z_sol ∈ Int` carries → one `z3ctx ∈
Z3SolverCtx` stub driving all three fields each tick, per the guardrail).
New carry unit test `types/z3_solverctx_carry.ev` (step-latched triple;
proves the autocarry synthesizes `_z3ctx ∈ Z3SolverCtx` so each field's
latched value persists).

Unit tests: PASS — 30/30. Gate: **PASS — 137/138** (only known
`123-subschema`; 0 timeouts; wall 416s). COMMITTED.

## Z3Sorts — the four base-sort handles (`z_isort/z_bsort/z_ssort/z_rsort`)

Second cohesive `z_*` sub-record. `type Z3Sorts(isort, bsort, ssort,
rsort ∈ Int)` unifies the Int/Bool/String/Real sort handles latched
consecutively in zinit (zsteps 5/6/7/8). Every type-directed Build*Z3
step picks one by the field/atom type string; all four are driven each
tick by DriverZInit (guardrail satisfied in the full driver).

Sites rewritten: 71 references across 4 modules, all READS (slot args
`int_sort_h ↦ z3sorts.isort` and ternary RHS values `… = "Real" ?
z3sorts.rsort`):
- `driver_ir.ev` — +1 type decl (`Z3Sorts`).
- `driver_zinit.ev` — four decl+latch lines → `z3sorts` record + four
  field latches. Doc header updated.
- `driver_buildeff.ev`, `driver.ev`, `driver_enum.ev`,
  `driver_record.ev` — slot-arg / ternary reads.
Fixtures: driver_enum/floor_walk (4 sort stubs → one `z3sorts` record
stub + driver_ir import), driver_buildeff/{select_w2,select_w5} (their
isort+bsort stubs → full `z3sorts` record driving all four fields, per
the guardrail), driver_zinit/latch_isort (read + comments →
z3sorts.isort; the module drives all four). New carry unit test
`types/z3_sorts_carry.ev`.

Unit tests: PASS — 31/31. Gate: **PASS — 137/138** (only known
`123-subschema`; 0 timeouts; wall 416s). COMMITTED.

## Z3Numerals — the cached 0..4 int-numeral handles (`z_zero..z_four`)

Third cohesive `z_*` sub-record. `type Z3Numerals(zero, one, two, three,
four ∈ Int)` unifies the five small int-numeral handles minted once in
zinit (zsteps 16/17/18/33/34 — z_three/z_four live in the later D2
section but latch the same way) so effects-array indices/lengths reuse
them instead of re-minting. All five driven each tick by DriverZInit.

Sites rewritten: 25 references across 2 modules, all READS (effects-index
ternaries `d_sel_i = 0 ? z3nums.zero : …`, length ternaries, the geq
floor `r_h ↦ z3nums.zero`, a `C2PushH(z3nums.zero)`):
- `driver_ir.ev` — +1 type decl (`Z3Numerals`).
- `driver_zinit.ev` — five decl+latch lines → `z3nums` record + five
  field latches (zero/one/two at zsteps 16-18; three/four at 33/34).
  Doc header updated.
- `driver_buildeff.ev`, `driver.ev` — the read sites.
Fixtures: driver_buildeff/{select_w2,select_w5} (their single `z_zero`
stub → full `z3nums` record driving all five fields, per the guardrail).
New carry unit test `types/z3_numerals_carry.ev`.

Unit tests: PASS — 32/32. Gate: **PASS — 137/138** (only known
`123-subschema`; 0 timeouts). COMMITTED.

## rt_* → RecTypeEntry ×3 record array — LANDED (shape 2)

The highest-line-impact type. The hand-unrolled record-type registry
(`rt_cnt` + a 42-field parallel-array: `rt_n0..2` names, `rt_f0..2`
field-name strings, `rt_t0..2` field-type strings, `rt_nf0..2` field
counts, `rt_sort0..2` / `rt_ctor0..2` / `rt_asort0..2` / `rt_ssort0..2`
handles, and the 3×6 accessor grid `rt_a00..rt_a25`) is now a fixed ×3
array of a typed `RecTypeEntry` record (`rt_e0/rt_e1/rt_e2`), declared
in `driver_ir.ev`:

```
type RecTypeEntry(name ∈ String, fnames ∈ String, ftypes ∈ String,
    nf ∈ Int, sort ∈ Int, ctor ∈ Int, asort ∈ Int, ssort ∈ Int,
    a0 ∈ Int, a1 ∈ Int, a2 ∈ Int, a3 ∈ Int, a4 ∈ Int, a5 ∈ Int)
```

### Why shape 2 (record ×3), not shape 1 (cons-list enum)
Shape 1 was attempted first and rejected on a concrete, verified block:
a registry walk needs a probe that recurses over the list, but **a claim
cannot call itself in an expression** — the oracle inlines claims, and a
self-referential call (`SumIL_total(rest)`) drops at emit with "couldn't
translate to Bool". So a cons-list walk could only be a bounded 3-deep
`match`-unroll, which (a) gives no advantage over the ×3 array (still
capped at 3) and (b) would force rebuilding the *in-place incremental* RD
builder — the registry is updated slot-by-slot across ticks, and a
cons-list cannot mutate an interior element, it must rebuild the whole
list each tick. Enum-list *carry* works (the corrected finding below is
right), but the *read layer* is the blocker, not carry. Shape 2 keeps the
≤3 cap but delivers the typed structure and the line win.

### Mechanism facts verified (load-bearing, before the rewrite)
- A **mixed String/Int record carries** across ticks (name latched, an
  Int field climbs) — `types/rec_type_entry_carry.ev`.
- A **whole record passes as a claim parameter** with `.field` reads in
  the body (`e0.name`, `e0.sort`) — this is the line win: the probes drop
  from ~8/12/22 flattened params to 3 slot records.
- The **prev-tick dual `_rt_e0` passes whole as a claim arg** (the
  internal dedup `RtIdxOf` reads the prior registry) — autocarry
  synthesizes `_rt_e0 ∈ RecTypeEntry`.
- A **full record pin inside an fsm** (constant each tick, all 14 fields
  covered) is the clean isolation-fixture stub — no carry/dual needed,
  satisfies the every-field-live guardrail trivially.

### Sites rewritten
- `driver_ir.ev` — +1 type decl (`RecTypeEntry`).
- `driver_record.ev` — the whole registry: `rt_cnt` kept as a scalar
  counter; the 42 array fields → `rt_e0/e1/e2`; all internal reads and
  ~80 state assignments → `rt_eK.field`; the three probes
  (`RtIdxOf`/`RtSortOf`/`RtFieldAcc`) re-signatured to take `e0/e1/e2`.
  `RtRecName` UNCHANGED — it is a pure fixed-width string-slice helper
  (takes arbitrary field strings, never the registry).
- External readers — `driver.ev` (RtIdxOf ×7, RtFieldAcc ×2, the
  `d_rv_*` / `c_sq_eltnm` / `d_mes_sort` / asort+ssort ternaries),
  `driver_broadcast.ev` (`.nf` / `.fnames`), `driver_pratt.ev`
  (`.name` / `.sort`), `driver_compose.ev` + `driver_classify.ev` +
  `driver_posbind.ev` (RtIdxOf + `.fnames`).
- Fixtures — the 6 registry-touching isolation tests
  (`driver_record/registry_lookup`, `driver_posbind/tuple_recognize`,
  `driver_broadcast/field_walk`, `driver_pratt/entry_kind`,
  `driver_compose/slot_capture`, `driver_classify/membership_pin`) now
  pin `RecTypeEntry` slots; new carry test `types/rec_type_entry_carry.ev`.

Net compiler2 source: **−56 lines** (133 added / 189 removed). The decl
block (42→3) and the probe signatures + multi-line call sites are the win;
the per-field state assignments stay 1:1 (one line per field per slot).

Unit tests: PASS — 33/33. Gate: **PASS — 137/138** (only known
`123-subschema-shadowing-quantifier` = compile error; 0 timeouts;
wall 431s; oracle builder). COMMITTED.

--- original (flawed-probe) finding, retained for the record: ---

The analysis proposed restructuring the record registry into a cons-list
enum of a `RecTypeEntry` element. The agent's probes (`xs ∈ IntList =
(is_first_tick ? ICons(7,INil) : ICons(step, _xs))` and `c ∈ Col =
(is_first_tick ? Red : _c)`) failed at emit with `_xs`/`_c` unbound — but
those probes omitted the `_xs ∈ IntList` / `_c ∈ Col` dual, so the
failure was the missing declaration, not an enum-carry limit. The viable
shapes are (a) a cons-list enum of `RecTypeEntry` with the carried-list
dual, or (b) a `RecTypeEntry` record unrolled ×3; both are large
self-contained rewrites of the `RtIdxOf`/`RtRecName`/`RtSortOf`/
`RtFieldAcc` probes and their ~25 call sites.

### Other candidates — assessed, deferred (with measured reasons)
- **`z_*` → a Z3 handle-bank record. DONE as three cohesive sub-records**
  (`Z3SolverCtx`, `Z3Sorts`, `Z3Numerals` — see the three sections
  above; 93 + 71 + 25 = 189 of the 345 sites collapsed). The original
  single-god-record idea was correctly rejected (it would force every
  weakly-related handle live every tick, violating fact #5). The
  remaining `z_*` handles (decl handles `z_lc_decl/z_argint_decl/…`, the
  effects-array consts `z_effs/z_elen/…`, `z_true/z_false`, the
  last_results/is_first_tick build-context consts) are weakly related to
  each other and to the three landed groups; any further split should be
  another cohesion pass, not one bank.
- Smaller element records (`Window8`/`ww_*`, `Frame`/`CFCons` payload,
  `MatchPinCtx`/`mp_*`). `ww_*` is cohesive but wide-surface (the token
  window is matched in nearly every classifier module). `mp_*` (65
  members) is a context, not a clean tuple. Tractable but lower value
  than completing FtiBuffer; left for follow-on.

## Pass 2 — type invariants (the "a type is its constraints" correction)

Operator feedback: the Phase-1 types were **anemic** — bare field bags
with no membership conditions. In a constraint language the type's body
is the point: the invariants that **bind the fields' relationships**.
Verified end-to-end (oracle instantiates a type body over `x`'s fields;
the kernel re-checks every tick; a violation forces `UNSAT` → exit 2).
CLAUDE.md gained a "Type invariants" section with two worked examples.

Final state on branch `type-invariants` (**bounds only** — see the
functionizer finding below for why the conditionals were dropped):

| Type | Invariants (landed) |
|---|---|
| `FtiBuffer(base, count, cap)` | `base ≥ 0`, `cap ≥ 0`, `0 ≤ count ≤ cap` — **added the `cap` field** so the per-site bound (`tbuf.count < 65534`, `stbuf < 8192`, `cibuf < 2048`) lifts into the type as the FTI memory-safety contract. Caps pinned in zinit. |
| `Z3SolverCtx(cfg, ctx, sol)` | `cfg ≥ 0`, `ctx ≥ 0`, `sol ≥ 0` |
| `Z3Sorts` | `isort/bsort/ssort/rsort ≥ 0` |
| `Z3Numerals` | `zero..four ≥ 0` |
| `RecTypeEntry` | `0 ≤ nf ≤ 6` (the registry's ≤6-accessor structural bound) |

### The functionizer wall (the load-bearing finding)

The first cut added the **lifecycle conditionals** too — `sol ≠ 0 ⇒
(ctx ≠ 0 ∧ cfg ≠ 0)` on `Z3SolverCtx`, last-latched-keyed implications on
`Z3Sorts`/`Z3Numerals`. Semantically sound (verified by violation tests),
but they **broke the compiler's performance**: the full conformance run
hit a **1800 s compile timeout on every fixture**, kernel RSS climbing.

Bisected on fixture 001 (clean baseline: 19 s, fully functionized,
`0.0 ms z3`):

| Variant | 001 | functionized |
|---|---|---|
| + all simple bounds (`≥0`, `0≤nf≤6`) | 19 s ✓ | yes (53 residual) |
| + `FtiBuffer` `cap` + `count ≤ cap` | 19 s ✓ | yes (62 residual) |
| + the three `⇒` conditionals | **>90 s timeout** ✗ | **no** |

**Cause:** a conditional is an *outputless boolean constraint*; the
functionizer extracts per-output assignments and can't extract it, so it
falls to Z3 residual and is re-solved every tick. On the compiler's hot
loop (thousands of ticks/compile) that means Z3 re-solves the whole
11 k-line model every tick. Plain bounds/comparisons extract for free.

**Resolution:** keep the bounds (incl. the `FtiBuffer` memory-safety
contract — that one extracts fine), drop the conditionals on hot
compiler state. Conditionals remain the right tool for **user-facing /
short-running** types. Documented in CLAUDE.md (⚠ perf caveat) + memory.
`RecTypeEntry`'s `sort ≠ 0 ⇒ ctor ≠ 0` was independently rejected anyway
(latch order: `sort` latches one zstep before `ctor`).

**Tests:** `tests/compiler2_units/type_invariants/` holds 3 violation
fixtures (`count` negative, `count` overrun past `cap`, `nf > 6`), each
asserting `UNSAT` → exit 2; the 3 conditional-violation fixtures were
removed with their invariants. 8/8 type unit tests green (5 carry + 3
violation); driver emits clean (11668 lines).
