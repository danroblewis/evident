# Self-hosting transformations — the `portable/` swap interface

The Rust runtime (~31K LOC) is being progressively reduced as pure
transformations move into Evident passes under `stdlib/passes/*.ev`.
This document covers the **call-site seam**: how a Rust function gets a
swappable Evident implementation, how to port one, and which runtime
gaps currently bound what a pass can do.

## Status — which transforms have been ported

| Transform | Rust | Evident pass | Faithful? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pretty` (AST → String) | `portable/pretty.rs::RustPretty` | `stdlib/passes/pretty.ev` | **partial** | ASCII, non-recursive subset only — see [Gaps](#runtime-gaps-that-bound-a-string-pass) |
| `validate` (95 LOC) | — | ⌛ | — | next candidate |
| `subscriptions` (176 LOC) | — | ⌛ | — | |
| `desugar` (273 LOC) | partial (`commands/desugar.rs`) | `stdlib/passes/desugar_passthrough.ev` | partial | pre-dates this seam; uses reflection path |
| `generics` (256 LOC) | — | ⌛ | — | |
| `inject` (588 LOC) | — | ⌛ | — | biggest |

"Faithful" = the Evident impl produces byte-identical output to the Rust
impl on the test fixtures.

## The pattern

Each swappable function gets one module under `runtime/src/portable/`.
It owns three things:

1. **A typed trait** — the function's Rust-level signature, independent
   of which impl backs it. (`PrettyImpl { fn expr(&self, &Expr) -> String;
   fn body_item(&self, &BodyItem) -> String; }`.)
2. **The Rust impl** — the original native code, the default. Fast,
   total, always correct. (`RustPretty`.)
3. **The Evident impl** — owns an `EvidentRuntime` with the stdlib pass
   loaded; marshals the Rust input into a `Value`, runs `rt.query`,
   decodes the output binding. (`EvidentPretty`.)

Every impl is also `Portable` (an `impl_name()` for tracing).

### Selection: by construction, not a registry

`EvidentRuntime::new()` is *not* modified to hold an impl slot. The impls
are standalone: a caller — or a cross-validation test — builds a
`RustPretty` or an `EvidentPretty` and calls the trait method. Each
module exposes `default_impl() -> Box<dyn Trait>` selected by an env var
(`EVIDENT_PRETTY_IMPL=rust|evident`), defaulting to Rust.

Rationale: standalone impls keep the seam side-effect-free (the choice
can't leak across queries), and they avoid touching `runtime/` internals.
A registry slot on `EvidentRuntime` is a viable future refinement once a
pass needs to be the *production* default — but until a pass is fully
faithful, the Rust impl stays the default and the Evident impl is
exercised by tests and opt-in env var.

### Marshaling: Rust value → `Value::Enum` → pass → `Value`

The pass pattern-matches on an Evident-side mirror of the AST defined in
`stdlib/ast.ev` (enums `Expr`, `BodyItem`, `SchemaDecl`, `Pins`, …). The
Rust side encodes its input as a `Value::Enum` tree whose enum/variant
names match those enums exactly, pins it as a `given`, and reads the
output from `QueryResult.bindings["out"]`.

```rust
// EvidentPretty::render — the whole seam in one place
let mut given = HashMap::new();
given.insert("item".to_string(), encode_body_item(item)); // → Value::Enum
let qr = self.rt.query("Pretty", &given)?;
match qr.bindings.get("out") { Some(Value::Str(s)) => s.clone(), _ => … }
```

The Evident claim declares its inputs as parameters and its outputs as
free vars:

```evident
claim Pretty
    item ∈ BodyItem        -- input, pinned via `given`
    out  ∈ String          -- output, read from bindings
    out = match item …
```

v1 uses a **per-port hand-written marshaler** (`portable/pretty.rs`'s
`encode_*` functions). It mirrors the private `*_to_value` family in
`translate/encode_ast.rs`; that surface is private (and `translate/` was
off-limits for this session), so the marshaler is duplicated locally,
which also keeps the port self-contained. A future cleanup can make the
`encode_ast.rs` mirror public and have every port share it (or add a
derive macro).

### Cost

The Evident path runs through `EvidentRuntime::query`, which JIT-caches
the compiled claim after the first call. Steady-state cost is a JIT
function call (~µs) plus marshaling — not a full Z3 solve. Loading the
pass file is the one-time construction cost, so **hold the Evident impl
across calls** rather than rebuilding it per call. `pretty` is not on a
hot path, so this is comfortable; for passes that run at every file load
(`inject`, `desugar`) the cached-function cost is what to budget for.

## To port a Rust function

1. Identify the signature (input types, output type).
2. Create `runtime/src/portable/<name>.rs` with the trait + `Rust<Name>`
   impl (move or wrap the existing native code). Add `pub mod <name>;`
   to `portable/mod.rs`.
3. Write `stdlib/passes/<name>.ev`: a claim taking the input as a
   parameter and exposing the output as a free var. Keep each claim
   **flat** (a single `match`/equality) — Evident can't recurse (below).
4. Add `Evident<Name>` to the portable module: marshal input → `Value`,
   `rt.query`, decode output. Reuse `encode_*` shapes from
   `stdlib/ast.ev`.
5. Add `runtime/tests/<name>_equivalence.rs`: assert
   `rust(x) == evident(x)` on representative inputs; pin known
   divergences so a future gap-fix surfaces them.
6. Make the old module a thin wrapper over `portable::<name>::Rust<Name>`
   (as `pretty.rs` now is) so existing call sites are unchanged.
7. Update the table at the top of this doc.

## Runtime gaps that bound a string pass

Porting `pretty` (a pure `AST → String` recursion) surfaced two
fundamental limits. Both must be fixed in `translate/` + `functionize/`
before an AST→String (or AST→AST) pass can be *fully* faithful. Until
then, a pass is faithful only on the **ASCII, non-recursive subset**.
(Also logged in `examples/COUNTEREXAMPLES.md`.)

### 1. Recursive claims don't constrain their outputs

A claim cannot recurse over a nested `Expr` tree of unknown depth.
There is a bounded-inlining mechanism (`translate/inline/recursion.rs`,
depth-capped at `EVIDENT_MAX_INLINE_DEPTH=64`), but the inlined frames'
outputs are left **unconstrained** — Z3 fills free values, so the result
comes back as garbage (both correct and wrong outputs are SAT).
Additionally, a claim call nested inside an expression
(`out = pretty(l) ++ …`) is **silently dropped** (`translate/inline/walk.rs`).
There is no `define-fun-rec`, no fold/catamorphism, no string-fold.

Consequence: only leaf / flat shapes render. Anything with sub-`Expr`s
(`EBinary`, `ECall`, `ESetLit`, quantifiers, mapping lists) cannot.
See the unchecked acceptance criteria in
`docs/plans/03-language-prereqs/01-recursive-claims.md`.

### 2. Non-ASCII string literals mangle through Z3

`Z3Str::from_str` treats a Rust `&str`'s UTF-8 bytes as a byte-sequence
of Z3 characters. A source literal `" ∈ "` comes back as
`\u{e2}\u{88}\u{88}` (JIT path — raw escape text) or `â\u{88}\u{88}`
(slow path — per-byte codepoints). Neither recovers `∈`. So a string
pass can only faithfully emit **ASCII**; every operator glyph `pretty.rs`
restores (`∈ ∀ ⇒ ∧ ¬ ≤ ≥ ↦ ⟨ ⟩ …`) is lost.

(The `given` round-trip of a `Value::Str(" ∈ ")` *appears* to work, but
only because the JIT identity-short-circuits and returns the input
`Value` unchanged — it isn't real Z3 Unicode support.)

### 3. (minor) JIT mishandles a `Bool` payload nested in an enum given

`match e { EBool(b) ⇒ (b ? "true" : "false") }` returns `"false"` for
both `true` and `false` under the JIT, but is correct on the slow path
(`EVIDENT_FUNCTIONIZE=0`). A nested `Bool` payload in an enum `given`
isn't threaded through the functionizer's match→ternary codegen. Bool
rendering is therefore excluded from the faithful subset rather than
shipped as a JIT-incorrect arm.

## What `stdlib/passes/pretty.ev` reproduces today

Faithful (byte-identical to `pretty.rs`):

- `PrettyExpr`: `EIdentifier(n)` → `n`
- `Pretty`: `BIPassthrough(c)` → `..c`; `BIClaimCall(name, ⟨⟩)` → `name`
  (empty mappings); `BIConstraint(EIdentifier)` → delegated to
  `PrettyExpr` by the Rust shim (mirrors `pretty.rs`, whose `body_item`
  Constraint arm calls `expr`).

Everything else renders to an ASCII sentinel (`<unsupported-…>`); the
equivalence test treats only the faithful shapes as authoritative and
pins the rest as known divergences.
